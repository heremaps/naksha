## Naksha_1.1.2

- Fixed batch-size failure issue for SNS publishing where one of the message fails during publish, then we optimize by continuing from that failure instead of re-processing entire batch 

## Naksha_1.1.1

- Introduced new query parameter `rlock` to indicate whether API transaction should `WAIT` or `ABORT` when there is DB row-level lock found during Updates.
  `ABORT` returns an error immediately back to consumers, thereby avoiding unnecessary waits at Database level under high concurrency updates. 
- Fixes:
  - PGSQL triggers fixed to handle missing `rtcts` and `version` fields for existing data migrated to newly created Naksha spaces
  - `xyz` namespace object fixed to return correct field values in API responses. We now use PGSQL based insert/update/delete feature operations.
  - Fixed Sequencer module to skip external connectors that don't have DB credentials to perform sequencing
  - Fixed Publisher module to skip SNS message attribute where it is found as empty string in message event
  - Fixed `handle` value in Iterate API response to support subsequent iterate operations using previous `handle` as offset
  - Event Publisher `fetch-newer-transactions` query fixed to improve performance (from 10 mins per call to 1 sec) for significantly bigger history table (e.g. 80+ million records or 190+ GB)
