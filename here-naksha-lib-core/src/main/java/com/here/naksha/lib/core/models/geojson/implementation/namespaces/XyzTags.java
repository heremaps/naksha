/**
 * Tags are special labels that can be added to features managed by Naksha. They are indexed and can be searched for. Actually they are
 * designed to prevent mistakes coming from normal string handling. Language is very complicated and often context related. For example, in
 * most languages {@code I} is lower-cased to {@code i}, but not in all languages. For example in Turkey the {@code I} is lower-cased to
 * {@code Ä±}. Therefore, lower-casing is not possible without knowing the locale. However, this is a storage system that should be language
 * agnostic, therefore this raises a problem.
 *
 * <p>For this purpose tags where made. They (by default) only allow latin letters, digits, colon underscore and minus. They are event, by
 * default, split by an equal sign into a key and a value part and those with the same key will override each other. This operation is
 * called compaction. When compaction is executed it will remove duplicates (by their keys) and sort all tags alphabetically to support
 * auto-merge algorithms in their work.
 *
 * <p>Sadly, sometimes it is required to add tags that do not fulfill these requirements, for example when unique identifiers are used as
 * tags, lower-casing them may turn them useless, because the identifier may be case-sensitive. There are other examples that add the need
 * to support case-sensitive tags. For these cases, by definition, all tags that start with the prefix {@code ref_} and {@code #} are not
 * lower-cased, nor are they split at the equals sign.
 *
 * <p>Using the special separator {@code :=} prevents case changes, but applies the split and merge algorithm, so {@code Is:=Now} will stay
 * as it is, but adding another tag later being {@code Is:=bar} will replace the first tag.
 *
 * <p>Actually this behavior is a server-side optimization and informal agreement. In the database itself, the tags are just a simple array
 * that allows duplicates, with order being significant and other no tweaks like lower-casing or split and merge. We may implement this
 * logic at some later time as well in the database triggers too, but right now this is not the case, therefore, you should invoke compact
 * ones after reading the values from the database. This object will remember if it was compacted, so invoking the method multiple times
 * does not have any impact. Beware that you can disable auto-compaction, then you have no guarantee the modification keeps this array in
 * the desired state.
