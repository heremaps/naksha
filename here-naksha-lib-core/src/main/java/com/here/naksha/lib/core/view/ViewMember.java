/**
 * Members that are not annotated for special visibility conditions, will always be part of the serialization and deserialization. When
 * members annotated with the {@link JsonView} annotation, then they have some distinct capabilities. How they are exported to clients or
 * how they are imported from clients, and if they are persisted into a storage.
 *
 * <p><b>Note</b>: Control can be fine-grained, so to make a virtual read-only property, that can only be read by clients, but does not
 * exist in the database nor is available otherwise internally, do the following: <pre>{@code
 * @JsonView({Member.Export.User.class, Member.Export.Manager.class})
 * @JsonGetter("foo")
 * public @NotNull String foo() {
 *   return "foo";
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * This will result in the property being part of the public REST API, but the client can't set it (no import rule), and it is not
 * serialized internally or stored in the database. It is recommended to not add the {@link JsonView} annotation, except some special
 * handling needed. In that case, whenever possible, use the default {@link ViewMember.User}, {@link ViewMember.Manager} or {@link ViewMember.Internal}
 * annotations, which declare import and export rules. Only for special cases do use individual fine-grained annotations.
