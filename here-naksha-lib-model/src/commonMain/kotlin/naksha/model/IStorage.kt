/**
 * Any entity implementing the [IStorage] interface represents some data-sink, and comes with an implementation that grants access to the data. The storage normally is a singleton that opens many sessions in parallel.
 *
 * Storages operate on maps. All storages do have an [administrative map][Naksha.ADMIN_CATALOG_ID], which can be virtual or real, implementation dependent. In this admin-map the storage exposes and manages the custom maps it stores, the transaction-logs of the storage, and the global dictionaries needed for the [JBON](https://github.com/heremaps/naksha/blob/v3/docs/JBON.md), plus optional implementation specific information.
 *
 * All other maps are custom maps, which are isolated data sinks within the same storage (like an own database schema, an own S3 bucket, an own SQLite database, an own directory or file, aso.). Each custom map is a fully separated storage entity. Within each custom map one [virtual admin collection][Naksha.COLLECTIONS_COL_ID] is exposed, which can be used to manage the collections in the map. Some storages allow to access multiple maps from one session, others may limit a session to a single map, and will reject cross map operations with [naksha.base.NakshaError.UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION].
 *
 * The storage will cache the dictionaries to avoid that just for [Tuple] decoding a new session need to be opened, which would require object creation for every single feature being decoded, therefore every storage implements the [IDictReader] interface, which internally should be attached to a storage local cache, that is automatically kept up-to-date. The same cache can be accessed from every [session][ISession], because every [session][ISession] implements as well the [dictionary-reader interface][IDictReader].
