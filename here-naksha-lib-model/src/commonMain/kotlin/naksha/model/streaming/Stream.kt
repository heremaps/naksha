/**
 * A stream that can be read to replicate the content of a collection. The data being streaming is dependent on the [StreamRequest].
 *
 * **A stream should only be read by a single reader thread!**
 *
 * Generally all data is grouped by the stream. Reading is done in chunks being either [StreamChunk] or [StreamTransaction]. The method [next] will block until all chunks that need to be processed have been [acknowledged][acknowledge].
 *
 * The recommended way to process a stream is that one thread performs the reading of chunks and then delegates the actual write to worker threads, which should [acknowledge][StreamChunk.acknowledge] the writing at the [chunk][StreamChunk].
 *
 * The following is the recommended read loop:
 * ```kotlin
 * fun readAll(stream: Stream) {
 *   stream.use { try {
 *     while (true) {
 *       if (stream.hasMore()) {
 *         // Read ones, write multiple.
 *         val chunk = stream.next()
 *         // This is important here!
 *         chunk.acknowledgeCount.addAndGet(targets.size)
 *         for (target in targets) {
 *           doWrite(chunk, target)
 *         }
 *       } else {
 *         if (stream.isDone(5.seconds)) break
 *         // There may be a retry, due to
 *         // recoverable write failure!
 *       }
 *     }
 *     // We are done.
 *   } catch (StreamException e) {
 *     // Recover via e.recoveryRequest!
 *   } catch (NakshaException e) {
 *     // Failure without recovery!
 *   }}
 * }
 *
 * fun doWrite(
 *   chunck: StreamChunck,
 *   session: IStreamSession
 * ) {
 *   Thread.startVirtualThread {
 *     try {
 *       session.write(chunk)
 *     } catch (Exception e) {
 *       log.error("Write error", e)
 *       chunk.failed(retry=false)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This allows to read ones and write in parallel into multiple targets _(e.g. into S3 and multiple replication databases)_.
 *
 * #### Warning
 * For each writer the reader forwards the read [chunk][StreamChunk] to, it should increment the [acknowledgeCount][StreamChunk.acknowledgeCount] by one. This **must** be done before handing the chunk over to the first processor/writer! This is important, because otherwise a very fast writer could decrement the [acknowledgedCount][StreamChunk.acknowledgeCount] to `0` before all writers are done!
 *
 * This would cause a fatal _(and hard to find)_ error. The moment the [acknowledgedCount][StreamChunk.acknowledgeCount] goes to `0` it will notify the reader that the [chunk][StreamChunk] is finished, this causes the reader to proceed. If not all writers are yet done, this can cause great harm to consistency of the target storages.
 *
 * #### Note
 * The example code is based upon JVM version 24+, because between 21 _(including)_ and 24 _(excluding)_ the virtual threads have a severe bug with synchronized methods and synchronization blocks, see [JEPS-491](https://openjdk.org/jeps/491) and [JDK-8337395](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8337395)!
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the stream to decide in which order it is safe to consume chunks.
 *
 * For transactions, it is safe to process them in parallel if they do not impact each other. That means, as long as transactions do not contain the same features as any other yet unacknowledged transaction, they can be written in parallel.
 *
 * For example a Naksha storage will read the transaction log, then use multiple connections in parallel to read the transactions. It will hand them out in order, but [next] will only block, when the next transaction contains a feature that is as well part of a previously returned [StreamTransaction], which was not yet [acknowledged][acknowledge].
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the stream to decide in which order it is safe to consume the data. Specifically with disabled transactions, the stream implementation is free to reorder data. So it can read features, then re-group them so that as many chunks as possible can be written in parallel, only ensuring that no feature is processed in parallel. This can make the copy many times faster for certain storages. However, it means that features will move between transactions and therefore destroys the transactional order and the consistency between features.
