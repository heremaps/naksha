Tests in this directory come from previous version of Naksha design.
The goal is to remove this directory entirely.
We should delete an old test **only** if one of the following holds true:
- given test does not make sense in current design
- given test was moved to "working test set" and fixed
- other test from "working test set" already covers the same logic
