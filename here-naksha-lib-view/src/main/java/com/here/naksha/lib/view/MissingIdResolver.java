/**
 * Defines the strategy for missing feature in one of the layers. <br>
 *
 * Consider this example:
 * Result from Storage A: [F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4]
 * Result from Storage B: [F_2, F_4]
 * Result from Storage C: [F_3, F_5] <br>
 *
 * The feature F_1 is missing in results from storage B and C, by providing {@link MissingIdResolver} you can decide
 * what to do with it, you can decide to try to fetch F_1 by id or to ignore it. <br>
 *
 * Here are couple examples of possible implementations:
 * 1. Ignore fetching more - perfect when your basic query is by ID (it doesn't make sense to search it again).
 * 2. Calculate missing features' IDs and try to fetch them by ID - good when your basic query is i.e. by Bbox
 * 3. Fetch only if feature is missing in specific Storage and query again only that Storage/layer.

   * As an input you get feature from layers where it was found, you can decide whether you want to query again (by ID) only
   * specific layer or all where feature is missing. <br>
   *
   * You can also implement your own way of ID calculation (for fetching) - maybe your json contains information about previous id:
   * { "id": "2345", "old_id": "11223" }
   * in this case you can try fetching by "old_id"
