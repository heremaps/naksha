# INSTRUCTION FOR NAKSHA API PERFORMANCE TEST SUITE

This test suite will perform a set of API calls in parallel against a running Naksha server and measure performance throughput. Currently employed APIs includes:

- GET features by tile ID `/hub/spaces/{spaceId}/tile/{type}/{tileId}`
- POST to patch one random feature from the previous call `/hub/spaces/{spaceId}/features`
- GET to query history of the patched feature `/hub/spaces/{spaceId}/search`

JMeter is required for this.

The test suite consists of:
- The JMeter script `naksha_local_load.jmx`.
- The file `tile_ids.csv` containing the tile IDs that will be used. The content can be modified as seen fit.

## Note: Manual setup

Currently the step to populate features for this test is not automated yet, and is already planned as a future work item. Hence this step needs to be performed manually once, so that the Naksha DB is ready.

Refer to the file `JMETER_TESTS.md`, at the 'Setup' section, and follow the instruction.

## Execute the test

To run the test suite on the CLI, run:
```shell
jmeter -n \
-t naksha_local_load.jmx \
-l result-load-test.csv >> stats-output.txt
```

Additionally, many custom settings can be supplied through JMeter params. To add a parameter, simply use the syntax `-J` followed by the parameter name, and assign its value using the equal sign. Example:

```shell
jmeter -n \
-t naksha_local_load.jmx \
-JNAKSHA_TEST_STORAGE=load_test_storage \
-l result-load-test.csv >> stats-output.txt
```
